## Syntax

```html
<label for=url>Enter Url</label>
<input id=url be-committed-to=#change>
<button id=change>Search</button>
```

What this does:

If you set focus on the input element, start typing, and click enter, it clicks on the "Search" button.


The "nudges" setting allows for setting the disabled attribute for the input element, and the nudges setting removes the disabled attribute (or lowers the number by one if set to a number higher than 1), so we can progressively enhance the input element, activating it when ready.


Referencing the module, as shown above, only affects input elements outside any ShadowDOM realm.

To affect elements within a ShadowDOM realm, add an instance the tag ["be-hive"](https://github.com/bahrus/be-hive) within the ShadowDOM realm.
